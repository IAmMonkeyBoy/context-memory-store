# Phase 6: Enhanced Ollama Integration Progress

**Branch**: phase6-enhanced-ollama-integration  
**Status**: In Progress

## Overview
Phase 6 focuses on enhancing our existing Ollama integration using the OpenAI .NET SDK v2.2.0 (latest). The goal is to improve performance, reliability, and capabilities while maintaining our existing API design.

## Current OpenAI SDK Status
âœ… **Already using OpenAI SDK v2.2.0** (latest version as of 7/3/2025)
- No version upgrades needed
- Focus on leveraging current SDK capabilities

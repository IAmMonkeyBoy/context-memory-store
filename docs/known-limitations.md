# Known Limitations and Deferred Enhancements

This document tracks known limitations, deferred issues, and planned enhancements that do not block current development but may be addressed in future phases.

## Overview

As of Phase 4 completion, the Context Memory Store system is functionally complete for its core objectives, but several enhancement opportunities have been identified and deferred to appropriate future phases.

## Current Known Limitations

### Testing Infrastructure
- **Fixed Sleep in Tests** (Issue #32): Some tests use fixed delays rather than intelligent retry loops
  - Impact: Occasional test timing failures in slow environments
  - Planned Resolution: Future testing enhancement phase
  - Workaround: Tests generally pass with current timings

### Development Environment
- **Script Permissions** (Issue #24): Shell scripts may require manual permission setting
  - Impact: Developer onboarding friction on some systems
  - Planned Resolution: Future developer experience improvements
  - Workaround: Manual `chmod +x` on affected scripts

### Service Startup Timing
- **Neo4j Startup Timing** (Issue #23): Neo4j service timing in test environments
  - Impact: Potential test environment instability
  - Planned Resolution: Phase 8 (Graph Storage Integration)
  - Workaround: Retry test scripts if needed

- **Qdrant Health Endpoint** (Issue #22): Health endpoint validation in testing scripts
  - Impact: Health check test failures (functionality unaffected)
  - Planned Resolution: Phase 7 (Vector Storage Integration)
  - Workaround: Manual verification of Qdrant health

### Monitoring and Observability
- **Neo4j Metrics Validation** (Issue #10): Metrics endpoint testing requires manual verification
  - Impact: Incomplete automated monitoring validation
  - Planned Resolution: Phase 12 (Prometheus Metrics Integration)
  - Workaround: Manual metrics verification

### Infrastructure Configuration
- **Neo4j Memory Settings** (Issue #8): âœ… **RESOLVED** - Memory settings now fully parameterized via environment variables
  - Status: Parameterized via `NEO4J_INITIAL_HEAP_SIZE`, `NEO4J_MAX_HEAP_SIZE`, and `NEO4J_PAGE_CACHE_SIZE`
  - Configuration: Environment variables with sensible defaults (512m/1g/512m)
  - Usage: Set environment variables or update `.env` file as needed

## Deferred Enhancements Timeline

### Phase 5: Core API Foundation
- **Focus**: API endpoint implementation
- **Deferred Issues**: None directly relevant

### Phase 6: OpenAI Integration
- **Focus**: Ollama backend integration
- **Deferred Issues**: None directly relevant

### Phase 7: Vector Storage Integration
- **Focus**: Qdrant integration
- **Address**: Issue #22 (Qdrant Health Endpoint)

### Phase 8: Graph Storage Integration
- **Focus**: Neo4j integration
- **Address**: Issue #23 (Neo4j Startup Timing)

### Phase 12: Prometheus Metrics Integration
- **Focus**: Monitoring and metrics
- **Address**: Issue #10 (Neo4j Metrics Validation)

### Future Infrastructure Phase
- **Focus**: Production readiness and developer experience
- **Address**: Issues #8 (Neo4j Memory), #24 (Script Permissions), #32 (Test Retry Loops)

## Impact Assessment

### Development Impact: MINIMAL
- All limitations have workarounds
- Core functionality is unaffected
- Development velocity is not significantly impacted

### Production Impact: LOW
- Most limitations affect testing/development environments only
- Infrastructure limitations have documented workarounds
- Performance impact is negligible

### User Impact: NONE
- All limitations are internal development/infrastructure concerns
- End-user functionality is not affected

## Mitigation Strategies

### Immediate (Phase 4)
1. **Document workarounds** in this file
2. **Provide troubleshooting guidance** in relevant documentation
3. **Monitor issue impact** during Phase 5 development

### Short-term (Phases 5-6)
1. **Track any new limitations** discovered during API development
2. **Prioritize issues** that begin affecting development velocity
3. **Update documentation** as workarounds evolve

### Long-term (Phases 7+)
1. **Address limitations** when working on related components
2. **Implement comprehensive solutions** rather than quick fixes
3. **Maintain backward compatibility** where possible

## Resolution Criteria

Issues will be considered for resolution when:

1. **Component Relevance**: Issue affects a component being actively developed
2. **Impact Escalation**: Limitation begins significantly affecting development
3. **User Impact**: Limitation begins affecting end-user experience
4. **Technical Debt**: Issue contributes to significant technical debt accumulation

## Conclusion

The identified limitations are manageable and do not prevent successful system operation or development progression. The deferred enhancement approach allows focus on core functionality while maintaining a clear roadmap for quality improvements.

All limitations have been assessed as non-blocking for Phase 4 completion and Phase 5 initiation.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `docker-compose up` to start all services
3. Validate installation: `./scripts/validate-services.sh`
4. Access the services:
   - Neo4j Browser: http://localhost:7474
   - Qdrant Dashboard: http://localhost:6333/dashboard
   - Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
   - Grafana: http://localhost:3000

## Validation and Testing

The Context Memory Store includes comprehensive validation tools:

```bash
# Quick health check
./scripts/health-check.sh

# Service functionality validation
./scripts/validate-services.sh

# Comprehensive testing (100% functional coverage)
./scripts/comprehensive-service-tests.sh

# Full infrastructure testing
./test.sh
```

See the [Service Validation Guide](service-validation.md) for complete validation procedures.

## Development

For development setup and workflow, see the main [README.md](../README.md) file.

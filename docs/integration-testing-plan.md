# Phase 5 Step 4: Comprehensive Integration Testing Plan

## Objective
Implement comprehensive integration testing to validate complete system functionality with actual service integrations and real data flows.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Test Infrastructure Setup
- Extend existing method-focused testing infrastructure to support integration testing
- Create dedicated test configurations for integration scenarios
- Set up test data fixtures and cleanup procedures

### Step 2: End-to-End Integration Test Suite
- Implement complete API workflow tests using the .NET 9 test framework
- Validate data persistence across Vector DB (Qdrant) and Graph DB (Neo4j)
- Test concurrent access patterns and system resilience under load

### Step 3: Service Integration Testing
- Create specific tests for Qdrant vector operations (store, search, retrieve)
- Validate Neo4j graph interactions with APOC procedures
- Test Ollama integration for both chat and embedding operations

### Step 4: API Endpoint Integration Testing
- Test all core REST API endpoints implemented in Phase 5
- Validate lifecycle operations (start/stop/context/ingest)
- Verify health monitoring and metrics collection endpoints

### Step 5: Docker Compose Integration Testing
- Validate container orchestration and service dependencies
- Test network connectivity between services via `host.docker.internal`
- Verify configuration management and environment setup

### Step 6: Performance and Load Testing
- Implement benchmark tests for API performance targets
- Monitor resource utilization during load testing
- Validate system behavior under stress conditions

## Success Criteria
- All integration tests pass
- Complete API workflows validated
- Performance benchmarks met
- Error handling thoroughly tested

# Code Directory

This directory contains snapshots of source code that has been ingested into the Context Memory Store.

## Structure

Code files are organized by:
- Programming language
- Project structure
- Timestamp of ingestion

## Usage

When source code is ingested into the memory store, a snapshot is saved here for reference and context. This allows the system to maintain historical context about code changes and evolution.

## File Organization

```
code/
├── snapshots/
│   ├── 2025-01-01_initial/
│   └── 2025-01-02_updates/
├── summaries/
│   ├── architecture.md
│   └── changes.md
└── metadata/
    ├── files.json
    └── dependencies.json
```

## Git Integration

This directory is designed to work seamlessly with git, allowing for:
- Version control of code snapshots
- Diff tracking between snapshots
- Historical analysis of code evolution

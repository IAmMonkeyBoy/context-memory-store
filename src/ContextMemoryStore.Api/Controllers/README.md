# API Controllers

This directory contains the ASP.NET Core Web API controllers that implement the REST endpoints.

## Planned Controllers

- **LifecycleController**: Memory engine lifecycle operations (start, stop, status)
- **MemoryController**: Memory operations (ingest, context, search)
- **HealthController**: Health check and system status endpoints

These controllers will be implemented in Step 4 of Phase 4.
